# Loan Approval AI Agent

An AI agent that processes loan approval guidelines from PDF documents and makes automated loan decisions based on applicant data.

## Tools Used

- **LangChain** - AI agent framework for document processing and LLM integration
- **OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo** - Language model for decision making and policy analysis
- **Pydantic** - Data validation and JSON serialization for loan applications
- **PyPDF** - PDF text extraction and document processing
- **Python** - Core programming language

## Architecture & Thought Process

### Why LangChain?

I chose **LangChain** for several strategic reasons:

1. **Agent Development**: LangChain makes it easy to create AI agents with minimal boilerplate code
2. **Future Scalability**: If additional features are needed (embeddings, vector stores, memory), LangChain provides seamless integration paths
3. **Testing & Performance**: LangChain includes built-in tools for testing and performance tracking, enabling scalable deployment
4. **Ecosystem**: Rich ecosystem of integrations and community support

### Why Pydantic?

**Pydantic** was selected for data validation and serialization:

- **Data Validation**: Ensures loan application data meets required formats and constraints
- **JSON Conversion**: Simplifies converting Python objects to/from JSON for API responses
- **Type Safety**: Provides runtime type checking and better IDE support
- **Documentation**: Auto-generates API documentation from data models

### Current Architecture

```
PDF Policy → Text Extraction → LLM Analysis → Structured Decision
```

**Key Design Decisions:**

1. **Simple Approach**: 4-page policies fit comfortably in GPT-4's context window
2. **Direct Processing**: No vector stores or embeddings needed for small documents
3. **Structured Output**: Pydantic models ensure consistent, validated responses
4. **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks when processing fails

### Decision Logic

The agent implements comprehensive loan approval logic:

- **Credit Score Analysis**: Low/Medium/High risk categorization (720+, 650-719, <650)
- **Income Validation**: Minimum income and employment duration requirements
- **Debt-to-Income Calculation**: Dynamic limits based on risk level (40%, 30%, 25%)
- **Special Cases**: First-time buyers (+5% DTI leniency), self-employed (24-month requirement)

## How to Run

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Set API Key
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key-here"
```

### 3. Run the Interactive Tool
```bash
python loan_runner.py
```

The tool will prompt you for:
- PDF policy file path (defaults to `loan_policy.pdf`)
- Loan application data (amount, income, debt, credit score, etc.)


## Future Improvements & Challenges

### Technical Improvements

#### 1. **Large Document Handling**
- **Current**: Sends entire PDF to LLM (works for 4-page documents)
- **Challenge**: Longer policies would exceed context limits
- **Solution**: Implement PyMuPDF for better text extraction and chunking strategies
- **Impact**: Enable processing of 50+ page policy documents

#### 2. **Web Application Development**
- **Current**: Command-line interface only
- **Need**: REST API using FastAPI for web integration
- **Features**: File upload, real-time processing, user authentication
- **Architecture**: Frontend + FastAPI backend + database

#### 3. **Flexible Data Handling**
- **Current**: Strict Pydantic validation requires all fields
- **Challenge**: Users may have incomplete application data
- **Solution**: Optional fields, partial validation, progressive data collection
- **Impact**: Better user experience and real-world applicability

#### 4. **Privacy & Security**
- **Current**: Basic error handling
- **Challenge**: Sensitive applicant information requires protection
- **Solutions**: 
  - Data encryption at rest and in transit
  - Audit logging and compliance tracking
  - Data anonymization for testing
  - GDPR/CCPA compliance features

### Scalability Challenges

#### 1. **Performance Optimization**
- **Current**: ~1-3 seconds per decision
- **Scale**: Need to handle 1000+ decisions/hour
- **Solutions**: Caching, async processing, load balancing

#### 2. **Cost Management**
- **Current**: ~$0.01-0.03 per decision
- **Scale**: High-volume processing could be expensive
- **Solutions**: Model optimization, batch processing, cost monitoring

#### 3. **Reliability & Monitoring**
- **Current**: Basic error handling
- **Scale**: Need comprehensive monitoring and alerting
- **Solutions**: Logging, metrics, health checks, automated recovery

## Current Limitations

1. **Document Size**: Limited to small PDFs
2. **Data Completeness**: Requires all application fields
3. **Privacy**: Basic security measures only
4. **Scalability**: Single-threaded processing
5. **Integration**: No web interface or API
